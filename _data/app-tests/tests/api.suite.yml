    # Some tests require complicated configuration in order to succeed and should therefore be skipped by default.
    # For example /app-tests/tests/api/Phive/Modules/Micro/Thunderkick/FreeSpinBetAndWinCest.php tests free spins
    # and requires that a free spin reward exists for the player/game, is activated, not expired and has remaining free spins.
    # Typically you need to create a trophy reward for the user in admin2 then activate it from the Videoslots profile page, then run the test.
    # All test files which require complicated configuration must include clear instructions at the top of the file.
    # To execute all tests except the complicated ones: php vendor/bin/codecept run --skip-group=complicated api
    # See https://codeception.com/docs/07-AdvancedUsage#Group-Files for more information.
